* Evals:
** eval 1 Keith
*** Controls
**** need a way to show non-intuitive controls (anything other than drag, really)

*** Piles/Decks
**** TODO hiding or drag to/from edges of screen?
**** DONE modifier key for placing at bottom of pile?
**** Keith says make it harder to shuffle: context menu? modifier?
***** actually: added a shake animation
**** easy to drop into wrong pile: weird cursor position and restriction interaction

*** Hand
**** TODO hiding? at least for environments and villains
**** TODO scrolling or stacking or something
***** maybe make the cards actually go into a container and lose their transforms, so they sit together (in a row)

** eval 2 Jeffery
*** TODO taking cards out of the deck: should autodraw

** eval 3 Jeffery
*** TODO discard issues: cursor position weirdness
*** hand:
**** TODO need more space/structure
**** TODO maybe smaller cards in hand
**** TODO double tap to modal (fullscreen)
**** TODO maybe stack: like tabletop or mac bar thing

** eval 4 kevin
*** damage tokens/trackers
*** remove card from game
*** change to pinch to zoom + dbltap to restor size
*** swap deck and discard

** eval 5ish me
*** touch navigation for all stuff
*** update pile counts when taking out from list
**** allow dragging out of list, not just tap to add
*** context menu: long press on pile
**** switch listing to tap, shuffle to doubletap or in context menu
**** allow swap deck and discard
*** hand should be bigger, with larger snap size
**** dragging slightly wierd in snap area
*** dark background

** eval 6 priscilla
*** drag and drop still sucks: especially into/out of piles
*** UI is still unintuitive

** eval 7
*** shuffle is too easy: suggestion: top to draw, bottom to shuffle
